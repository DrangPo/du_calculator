This program will triangulate position of the ore in Dual Universe
If you use multiple monitors please capture screenshot only from the one running DU. Screenshot function only works for full hd displays (1920x1080), different resolutions will be added when asked.

5. (App) paste position to field 
6. (DU) open scanner, (tab + left click on it)
7. (DU) take screenshot
8. (App) click on frame icon (it will estimate distance to ore) 
9. (DU) move to any direction (not recommended walking all time in straight line, and all position cant be done on one ground level)
10. !!! repeat steps 3.-9., three more times !!!
11. (App) click "Get ore position"
12. (DU) paste to chat
13. (DU) right click on chat, set as destination
